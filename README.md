# Power-BI-Used-Textile-Analysis
🌍 International Trade Analytics - Export Strategy for HS Code 6310 using Power BI

📌 Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to perform an in-depth trade analysis of HS Code 6310 — used rags, scrap twine, cordage, rope and cables and worn clothing and other worn textile articles — with the goal of identifying the best export destinations from India.

Our approach combines data analytics, international trade insights, and interactive dashboards to drive a data-backed export strategy.

🔍 Objective
To analyze the global trade landscape for HS Code 6310 and determine the most promising countries for Indian exporters, using comprehensive trade metrics and visualization tools.

📚 Methodology

✅ Step 1: Identifying Top Exporting Countries (HS Code 63)
We started by analyzing global exports under HS Code 63 (Textile articles).

We found: China is the largest exporter, followed by India and Pakistan.

📌 This helped understand India’s position in the broader HS code family.

✅ Step 2: Drilling Down to the 4-Digit Level – Choosing HS Code 6310
We narrowed down to analyze India's performance across HS codes:

HS 6302 (Bed linen) and HS 6304 (Other furnishing articles) showed strong performance.

We chose HS 6310 due to:

- An 8% annual growth rate
- 4.9% global share held by India

✅ Step 3: Comparative Advantage Analysis (RCA)
To measure competitiveness, we calculated the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) for each country at the 4-digit level.

Although China leads overall exports, Bangladesh has the highest RCA in HS 6310 India has a moderate comparative advantage.

📊 RCA helped us understand not just volume, but efficiency and specialization of countries in exporting HS 6310.

✅ Step 4: Identifying Top Importing Countries

We then focused on demand side — identifying top importers of HS 6310 globally. India (due to recycling industry) is the largest importer Followed by USA, Spain, and Germany

📈 Key Insights
- India is a strong player in textile exports overall but has scope for improvement in HS 6310.
- Bangladesh's high RCA makes it a significant competitor in this product.
- India, while a top importer, can reposition itself to become a re-exporter by targeting markets like USA, Spain, and Germany.
- There's a growing global market for sustainable and recycled textiles.

🔮 Future Scope
- Expand analysis to include Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) and Logistics performance 
- Expand analysis for sub-heading to 8-10 HS code level
- Add profitability estimation by merging cost data with market price
