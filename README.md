## üåç **International Trade Analytics** - Export Strategy for HS Code 6310 using Power BI

## üìå **Project Overview** 
This project leverages Power BI to perform an in-depth trade analysis of HS Code 6310 ‚Äî used rags, scrap twine, cordage, rope and cables and worn clothing and other worn textile articles ‚Äî with the goal of identifying the best export destinations from India.

Our approach combines data analytics, international trade insights, and interactive dashboards to drive a data-backed export strategy.

## üîç **Objective** : 
To analyze the global trade landscape for HS Code 6310 and determine the most promising countries for Indian exporters, using comprehensive trade metrics and visualization tools.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated
- Data Analytics
- International Trade Analysis
- Power BI Data Modeling
- Dashboard Design
- Power Query Transformation
- Product Market Strategy


## üìö Methodology

‚úÖ **Step 1**: Identifying Top Exporting Countries (HS Code 63). We started by analyzing global exports under HS Code 63 (Textile articles).

**Observation** 
- We found, China is the largest exporter, followed by India and Pakistan.
- This helped understand India‚Äôs position in the broader HS code family.

‚úÖ **Step 2**: Drilling Down to the 4-Digit Level ‚Äì Choosing HS Code 6310. We narrowed down to analyze India's performance across HS codes:

- HS 6302 (Bed linen) and HS 6304 (Other furnishing articles) showed strong performance.
- We chose HS 6310 due to:
 - An 8% annual growth rate
 - 4.9% global share held by India

‚úÖ **Step 3**: Comparative Advantage Analysis (RCA) To measure competitiveness, we calculated the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) for each country at the 4-digit level.

- Although China leads overall exports, Bangladesh has the highest RCA in HS 6310 India has a moderate comparative advantage.
- RCA helped us understand not just volume, but efficiency and specialization of countries in exporting HS 6310.

‚úÖ **Step 4**: Identifying Top Importing Countries, We then focused on demand side ‚Äî identifying top importers of HS 6310 globally. India (due to recycling industry) is the largest importer Followed by USA, Spain, and Germany

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies Used

Tool	Purpose
- Power BI	Data transformation, modeling, and dashboarding
- Power Query	ETL - Cleaning and transforming raw trade data
- DAX	Calculated metrics and KPI definitions
- Trade Map Data	Source for export/import data and trade flows


## üìà Key Insights
- India is a strong player in textile exports overall but has scope for improvement in HS 6310.
- Bangladesh's high RCA makes it a significant competitor in this product.
- India, while a top importer, can reposition itself to become a re-exporter by targeting markets like USA, Spain, and Germany.
- There's a growing global market for sustainable and recycled textiles.

## üîÆ Future Scope
- Expand analysis to include Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) and Logistics performance 
- Expand analysis for sub-heading to 8-10 HS code level
- Add profitability estimation by merging cost data with market price
